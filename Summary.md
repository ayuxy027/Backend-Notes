## How Backend Works in HTTP 

- When you fire a request on a web browser
1 Browser parses the URL
2 Does DNS lookups 
3 Establishes Connection with the IP (does      handshake)
>Use of DNS is to connect with IP with name not the actual Number of IP Address
- Common Methods for creating HTTPS connections are **GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH**.

- While getting response HTTP gives status codes 
1 **200** means success
2 **404** means failure
3 **403** means forbidden
4 **500** means server error
